                        <p>Now, there is a path to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) in the automation of conversational dialogue. Modern technology and applications are developing constantly to hear a voice, decipher the intent of the caller’s question and quickly connect them to the right input for an answer.
<br><br>
Conversational AI is used to “humanize” interactive voice response (IVR) systems and create intelligent virtual agents (IVAs)  that recognize a caller’s intent and respond with an appropriate answer. They can even hear elevated emotions, such as frustration, and quickly connect the caller to a live agent.
<br><br>
Instead of forcing callers to navigate through phone menus, you can now ask, “How can I help you?” This brings a human-like touch to what was once an automated and emotionless menu system. Deliver better customer experiences, connect more quickly and curb customer frustration with NLP and the next generation of voice communications.<br><br></p>

                               A positive customer experience can be expedited by determining caller intent quickly. Consumers are more comfortable describing what they need in their own words. Conversational AI applications are trained to listen to these words to discover the caller’s intent and determine what action needs to be taken. The applications cut through the red tape of tedious phone menus to direct callers to the right self-service solution or route callers to live agents.y determining caller intent quickly, a positive customer experience can be expedited.

                        Prompts and phone tree menus can be inefficient, if the IVR application suite is extensive, which in turn increases caller frustration. Conversational AI and NLP can determine caller intent faster and decrease overall call handling time. When your contact center’s average handle time (AHT) is decreased, everyone wins!
