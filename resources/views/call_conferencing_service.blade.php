This mute feature can be used when you are on a conference call and are in a crowded or very noisy setting to eliminate the background noise in the conference bridge. It is very important that you have a clear, quality conference call, so this feature is crucial for any conference participant to use.

                        <p>Cafmotel Conferencing’s audio and web bridge is secured by the moderator who is conducting the calls. We offer our clients a unique PIN number for the moderator to use on all the features of the conference bridge including securing the bridge. You also have an option as the moderator to remove security from your conference call so anyone can join in the conference. Security of our bridge is one of our top priorities as an audio and web conferencing company. We want our clients to trust us and use our bridges without any worry about security among the participants. Once the security setting is done by the moderator, our clients will be at ease that what is being discussed on the bridge remains with the participants who are a part of that conference call.

There are more meetings than ever which are taking place online. During conference calls, the quality of the audio is the most crucial factor for having a flawless conversation and clear understanding of the conference meeting. Increased mobility of businesses and individuals, means more team meetings, online meetings vs boardroom meetings, and customer service. Crystal-clear audio quality paired with most up to date technology, provides a superior user experience, making every audio conferencing call more efficient and productive. We think that audio quality is the most important element in determining the success of an online conference. Poor quality can result in missed communication, lost productivity, and poor outcome. That’s why we, at Cafmotel Conferencing make sure that our conference audio quality is at an optimum voice quality and that we provide the best conference experience possible.
